### API testing:

> This learning path teaches you how to test APIs that aren't fully used by the website front-end. You'll learn key API recon skills to help you discover more attack surface. In addition, you'll learn how to identify server-side parameter pollution vulnerabilities that may impact internal APIs.

### Server-side vulnerabilities

> This learning path introduces you to a range of common server-side vulnerabilities. This is perfect if you're new to web security and want to get an overview of the kinds of vulnerabilities that exist, as well as how an attacker might identify and exploit them in real-world systems.
