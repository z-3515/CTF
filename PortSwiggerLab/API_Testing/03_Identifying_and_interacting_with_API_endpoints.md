# Identifying and interacting with API endpoints

## Identifying API endpoints

You can also gather a lot of information by browsing applications that use the API. This is often worth doing even if you have access to API documentation, as sometimes documentation may be inaccurate or out of date.

You can use Burp Scanner to crawl the application, then manually investigate interesting attack surface using Burp's browser.

While browsing the application, look for patterns that suggest API endpoints in the URL structure, such as `/api/`. Also look out for JavaScript files. These can contain references to API endpoints that you haven't triggered directly via the web browser. Burp Scanner automatically extracts some endpoints during crawls, but for a more heavyweight extraction, use the JS Link Finder BApp. You can also manually review JavaScript files in Burp.
