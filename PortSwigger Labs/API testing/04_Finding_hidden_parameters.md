# Finding hidden parameters

When you're doing API recon, you may find undocumented parameters that the API supports. You can attempt to use these to change the application's behavior. Burp includes numerous tools that can help you identify hidden parameters:

- Burp Intruder enables you to automatically discover hidden parameters, using a wordlist of common parameter names to replace existing parameters or add new parameters. Make sure you also include names that are relevant to the application, based on your initial recon.
- The Param miner BApp enables you to automatically guess up to 65,536 param names per request. Param miner automatically guesses names that are relevant to the application, based on information taken from the scope.
- The Content discovery tool enables you to discover content that isn't linked from visible content that you can browse to, including parameters.
